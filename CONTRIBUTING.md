# Contribution Guidelines

All contributions are welcome!

Before submitting a PR or an Issue, please familiarise yourself with the following guidelines:

- Read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Report any JUCE bugs according to the [JUCE Framework's Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/.github/contributing.md).
- The best way to report an issue is to write a failing test.
  - See pretty much any file in the repository for examples.
- The best way to get a PR accepted is to make a failing test pass.
- Be aware that your code may be rewritten, reformatted, or refactored to meet the standards of the rest of the codebase.
  - The original author will be listed as a co-author for any new/amended commits made to their contribution.
- All branches must be rebased on `main` before merging.
